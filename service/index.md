# Public Service Enterprise

Black Radley works with public services to inspire
and invigorate systems and people.
We want public service to achieve the best for the people it serves.
We provide bespoke solutions to public service challenges:
leadership, performance, fairness, and change

## Purpose clarity

21st Century public service leadership is tough. Changing demographics, evolving patterns of demand, the inter-related complexity of each service â€“ these create conditions in which success is hard to achieve. We help build a shared sense of meaning, mapping out the challenges, providing one-to-one support, drawing on our cross-functional expertise and experience to suggest new angles, new connections, and ways to build system and personal resilience.

* Strategic planning
* Business planning
* Facilitation
* Board performance
* Top tier coaching/mentoring

## Performance improvement

In the fast changing, highly politicised, transparent world of public service, improving performance, efficiency and public approval can seem impossible. We help reframe the challenge, finding new angles and robust solutions to entrenched issues, internal or external. We deal in practicalities and in sustainable, hard-won answers.

* Financial modelling
* Metrics and measurement
* Management Information planning
* Performance review process design
* Performance challenge
* Enterprise skills development
* Enterprise management development

## Governance design

Effective public services are enterprising, responsive and fair. But risk management all too easily becomes risk-aversion. Services can become fixed and unfair. We help organisations clear away the clutter, refocusing on their core purpose, and adopting processes that achieve the right balance between control and empowerment.

* Risk/reward analysis
* Assurance and control systems
* Management options analysis
* Legal options analysis
* Transition support
* Fairness analysis

## Change management

In all this complexity, change is hard to achieve. The old models of hierarchies and centrally directed change have run out of steam. The new world requires continual adaptation and fluid networks. We help organisations and partnerships become adaptive; embedding change at the front line level without losing quality control.

* Change facilitation
* Project management
* Project assurance
* Project governance
