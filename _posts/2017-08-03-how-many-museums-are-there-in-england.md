By Joe Collins

The Arts Council (in [A review of research and literature on museums and libraries September 2011]({{site.url}}/assets/Insight-Final-Report-2015-11-11.pdf)) estimated that there are 1,600 museums in England.  Thinking that there maybe more I counted the number of museums in England listed on Wikipedia. 

Wikipedia listed 2,728 museums in England. Maybe the Arts Council is under estimating the size of the museums sector.  Alternatively they maybe using a more demanding definition than the Wikipedians are of what a museum is.

And no, I didn't count them by hand, I got a computer to do it for me ([Museum Mapping Project](https://github.com/blackradley/heathmynd)).
