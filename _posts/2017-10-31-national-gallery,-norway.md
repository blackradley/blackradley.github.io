The National Gallery, Oslo, great café, shame about the entrance.

The French Salon café at Norway's national gallery is a hidden gem.  The sadly it is hidden pretty effectively, it isn't visible from the outside and there are 21 steps up to the very heavy front door of the museum.  Once you are in the museum the café is hidden at the back of the shop.  From a designers point of view there are very few "perceived affordances" for a café visit.
