Visiting the Atkinson in Southport today to look at museum affordances and hindrances to commercial performance.

The Atkinson represents a positive attempt to blend commericial opportunities with a museum and library.  The entrance is level and the opportunities for shopping and refreshment are obvious from the outside.  The foyer attempts to seamlessly join the shop, cafe and entrance.  The museum and the library draw visitors through the foyer.  

The sausage rolls aren't bad either.
