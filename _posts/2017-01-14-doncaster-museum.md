Visiting the Doncaster Museum and Gallery today to look at museum affordances and hindrances to commercial performance.

Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery gives the impression of a well-run (and probably well loved) museum.  However it is hampered by its physical location and layout which inhibit the possibilities of boosting visitor numbers and providing enhanced retail and refreshment offers.  Faced with these inhibitions the staff and management has gone to some considerable effort to ameliorate their effects.  The warm welcome and explanation provided by reception staff is one of the more obvious strategies.  Never-the-less one is forced to conclude that there is a limit to how effective these technique can be and that improving commercial performance by a substantial amount would require some radical revision of the site.
