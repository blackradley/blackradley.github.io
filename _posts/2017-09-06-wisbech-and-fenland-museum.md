![Wisbech & Fenland Museum](/img/WisbechAndFenland.jpg)

By Joe Collins

Visited the Wisbech & Fenland Museum today for no other reason than that it was raining.

Wow.  What a stunner.  It is a kind of museum of museums.  There's a shop and some friendly volunteers at the front, but the rest of the museum is straight out of a Victorian time warp.  The exhibits including the dis-membered mummified hand in a gilt frame and an albatross.  I didn't see a shrunken head but I can't believe there isn't one in there.
