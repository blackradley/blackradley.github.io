by Peter Latchford 

Would you build an igloo in Africa? The UK public sector spends billions every year doing the equivalent. Citizens do not get the support they need. Politicians of any stripe seem powerless in the face of the grinding leviathan machine that is the public service system. If you are an MP, a councillor, or a senior manager; if you manage public services or work on or with the front line, this book is for you. If you work in health, regeneration, housing, benefits, social services, education, enterprise support - any part of the public sector - it will help you see where the problems are, and how you can help take a lead in solving them.
