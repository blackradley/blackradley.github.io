# A new Enlightenment: strengthening civic museums 

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}

The think piece, authored by Peter Latchford of Black Radley Ltd, examines the particular qualities, value and importance of civic museums, identifies the challenges they face, and explores what they should do to thrive and become more relevant and resilient in the future. Latchford argues that to survive, civic museums must see themselves as part of the wider ecology that surrounds them, building a sense of place, rather than caring for collections in splendid isolation.
