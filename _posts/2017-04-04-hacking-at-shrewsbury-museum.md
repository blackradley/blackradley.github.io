This week the Black Radley development team are working with a team from Microsoft at [Shrewbury Museum and Art Gallery](http://www.shrewsburymuseum.org.uk/) for a week long hack.  The goal is a use facial recognition software to allow exhibits to intelligently interact with visitors.  It should be possible for an exhibit to identify when a visitor is looking at it and start telling the visitor about itself.
