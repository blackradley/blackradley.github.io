# Cultural Enterprise

Black Radley Culture works with cultural organisations,
Local Authorities, Museums, Libraries, Archives,
Heritage Organisations, Trusts, Charities and Funders.
We use proven methodologies to reinvigorate locations and organisations.
We deliver Cultural Strategies, Business Plans,
Commercial performance and Governance improvement.

## Commercial performance

Cultural organisations are principally concerned with the quality of their product or offer. We help them ensure that quality converts into a strong and sustainable financial model.

* Team performance support
* Management information processes
* Rapid Enterprise Assessment
* Enterprise skills development
* Enterprise management development
* Visitor experience mapping

## Governance design

Effective cultural organisations balance artistic integrity with enterprise. Both of these imperatives requires effective and complementary risk management. But risk management can become unwarranted risk-orientation (too much risk) or risk-aversion (too little). We help organisations achieve the right balance between control and empowerment, between artistic and commercial risk.

* Risk/reward analysis
* Assurance and control systems
* Management options analysis
* Legal options analysis
* Transition support

## Problem solving

Cultural organisations are problem solving organisations. In this environment, the tough management challenges concern complex, multi-layered issues where there are no clear right answers. We are experienced facilitators of complex adaptive change, moving situations forward with the support and involvement of key stakeholders.

* Stakeholder analysis
* Options analysis
* Project management
* Project support
* Executive coach
